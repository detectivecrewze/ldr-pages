## 🛠️ Main Features

### 1. General Settings & Theme
*   **App Name**: Change "Long Distance Love" to your own custom title (e.g., "Our Story").
*   **Colors**: Use the color pickers to choose primary and secondary colors that match your partner's favorite palette.
*   **Backgrounds**: Choose between a modern Romantic Gradient, a Retro Win98 look, or a Minimalist design.

### 2. Login & Security
*   **Secret Password**: Set a password that only your loved one would know.
*   **Relationship Start Date**: This date is used to calculate exactly how many days you've been "connected."
*   **Cover Photo**: Upload a special photo that greets them before they even log in.

### 3. Relationship Dashboard
*   **Locations**: Set your home city and theirs. The system automatically calculates the distance and handles timezone differences for the clocks.
*   **Map Picker**: Click the map icon to pinpoint exact coordinates.

### 4. Journey Map & Highlights
*   **Milestones**: Track your biggest moments (First Meet, First Flight, etc.).
*   **Photo Metadata**: When you upload a photo, the admin will attempt to automatically read the **Date** and **Location** (EXIF data) to fill in the fields for you!

### 5. Shared World (Playlist & Media)
*   **Playlist**: Add your favorite songs by pasting direct audio URLs.
*   **Date Ideas**: Curate a list of activities for your next call.
*   **Gallery & Videos**: Add photos and videos of your memories.

### 6. The Promise (Digital Letter)
*   **Auto-Typing Letter**: Write your heart out. When your partner reaches this page, the letter will "type itself" for a romantic effect.
*   **Vows**: Add individual promises you make to each other.
*   **The Big Day**: Set an "End of LDR" date to start the ultimate countdown to when you close the distance for good.

## 💾 Saving Your Work
*   **Autosave**: The admin automatically saves your progress to your browser's local storage. You can close the tab and come back later; your changes will still be there.
*   **Exporting**: When you are completely finished, click the **Save/Download** icon in the footer. This will download a `data.js` file. Replace the existing `data.js` in your project root with this new file to make your changes permanent for the live site.

## 💡 Pro Tips
*   **Direct URLs**: For music and photos, ensure you use direct links (ending in .mp3, .jpg, .png).
*   **Resetting**: If you want to start fresh, use the "Clear Storage" option in the console or clear your browser's cache for the site.
*   **Mobile Preview**: Use the "Eye" icon to toggle between Desktop and Mobile views in the preview pane.
